# proprietary-ninja

Small game inspired by fruit ninja, to be played on a touch screen (but you will still be able to play with a mouse).

# How to enjoy this master piece ?

Install [SDL2](http://libsdl.org/), [SDL2-image](https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/) and [SDL2-ttf](https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf/).
You will also need a C compiler and make.

If you are using Linux, it should be something like:
```
$ apt-get install build-essential make libsdl2-dev libsdl2-image-dev libsdl2-ttf-dev
```

To compile it, type:

```
$ make
```

And the binary `proprietary_ninja` should appear.

# What does it look like ?

*(It is very worth your bandwith, if you were wondering)*
